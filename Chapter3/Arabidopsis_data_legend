Introduction
This repository provides Arabidopsis thaliana population datasets measuring meiotic interference parameters using triplet marker models. Each dataset includes standardized output from Dr. Ronin’s analysis pipeline, formatted for direct import and downstream comparison.

Model Sequence and Blocks
Triplet models proceed hierarchically as follows:

No sex difference: Single r’s, single c

No interference: c fixed at 1

Sex-specific recombination: r₁₂, r₂₃ by sex; c may be shared or separate

Sex-specific interference: Separate c for each sex (mc0, mc1)
